# ðŸš° Spigot

A webhook queueing solution for Jenkins designed with AWS.

The spigot allows you to perform maintenance on Jenkins without losing any data. Typically, when upgrading and restarting your instance, any incoming webhooks will receive errors and no tests will kick off. However, with the Spigot, these webhooks are instead stored in a queue, and processed when Jenkins is back online.

The spigot can be turned off manually by running the toggle_spigot.py script with the flag --spigot_state OFF. In addition to this, the system will turn itself off if the send_from_queue lambda fails a health check on your jenkins instance.

# AWS

The following aws infrastructure is needed to utilize the code in this repository.

## AWS Setup

The following will need to be configured in the API Gateway:

* An API Stage Variable called **spigot_state** set to ON or OFF
* The Method Request will need:
    * A query_string parameter called **from_queue**
    * An HTTP Request header called **X-Github-Event**
* The Integration Request will need:
    * A body mapping template as follows:
    ```
    {
      "spigot_state": "$stageVariables.spigot_state",
      "from_queue": "$input.params('from_queue')",
      "body": $input.json('$'),
      "headers": {
        #foreach($header in $input.params().header.keySet())
        "$header": "$util.escapeJavaScript($input.params().header.get($header))" #if($foreach.hasNext),#end
        #end
      }
    }
    ```
* The Method Response will need:
    * A 200 HTTP Status
    * A 50 HTTP Status
* The Integration Response will need:
    * A default Lambda Error Regex mapping to a 200 Method response status
    * A Lambda Error Regex of **(\n|.)+** mapping to a 500 Method response status

The Lambdas will need:
* An environment variable called **LOG_LEVEL** with the desired cloud watch log level

Other setup:
* We have 2 s3 buckets that are also part of the spigot. One is used for deploying changes to lambda code, the other is for keeping credentials (such as the github token for posting on prs)
* The send_from_queue is triggered every 5 minutes with a cloudwatch event trigger
